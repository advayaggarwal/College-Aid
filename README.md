## About The Project

Nowadays Almost all College Students are living at home except for PhD students which leads to 
* Very Little interaction between mates and their seniors or Juniors
* Juniors having Lack of Face to face Guidance with their seniors (Excluding any kind of online mentorship)
* The majority of students have difficulty finding relevant and handy notes for their Semester Preparation

Hence, we developed a web application to help college students overcome these drawbacks

<br />

## This project has the following features:
* Uploading Notes
* Post items for sale
* Announcement and Updates
